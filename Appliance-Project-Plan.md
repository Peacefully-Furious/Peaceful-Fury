# Appliance Project Plan:

Attached is a PDF of the Markdown based, single sourcing training materials appliance I designed for T-Mobile. I think this report will give you an idea of how open source tools can work together in a manner that “big box” software cannot. Please keep in mind that the tool and the system are in “beta state. Please be kind! :)

Here is my Proposed Plan (which after this email will be added to git hub for versioning and distribution to the Open Source Community:

For the Appliance, I need to do the following:

1. Remove all to T-Mobile content.

2. Add my new content (not sure what, but it will be something related to the arts and the humanities and designed.

3. Update the tools visual look by editing the CSS file that controls the look and feel of all of the documents and also creating multiple CSS files that can mirror the branding style of different universities. Run these CSS changes by a friend of mine who is a graphic designer/CSS whiz and get her feedback

4. There is one custom piece of software of that I would like someone with programming expertise to examine possible update and definitely develop a specification for.

5. The tool is on GitHub

7. Other ID (primary academic)feedback

8. Investigate what it would take to make tool a stand alone appliance and see how system components could be revised

5. Test Revise Test!! :)

5 Identify and select various audiences (academic and business to see how the Appliance handles academic and business content
508 for academic and 504 compliance capabilities.

For the Appliance Report, I need to do the following:

1. Create a simpler version of the report by for first non technical (IDs and technical writes -

 - removing of eplaing terms that  ( the beta version of this plan was like them reading Eskimo)

 - Add more visuals that show how the various segments of the tool interact.

2. Test this Report with non technical audience

3. Select and use a more formal ( like API) to cite references

4. Spin the report off into a white paper for  for non technical business executives and other project controllers

5. Add report white paper to Github for versioning and review

6. Test Revise Test

7. Share on My soon to be released ID website (I have the contentment for one from a previous site but I need the content for the second one , which will be using the appliance from an academic perspective)

8. Scope Present report/white paper at various professional associates (local local ASTD, Duke Conference for Academic IDS) as markdown guru/adevocate
