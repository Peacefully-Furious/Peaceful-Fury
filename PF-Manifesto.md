Sumus te. Tu nobis?

We are neural atypicals. We are ADHD. We are Aspergers. We are Autistic. We are OCD. We are Tourette's. We are the neural minorities in a neurotypical world. We attend your schools and sit next to you at your jobs. We are 4 percent of the world's population but, like neural snowflakes, each of us is unique.

We have been sentenced to inadequate special education programs and then paroled to sit in classrooms with the neural normals, who whisper and point at us and say "they are special." Then, we struggle with conventional schooling because we are frustrated with pedagogy that neither stimulates not represents how we learn.

Somehow we persevere, graduate and work. But, the neural normals relabel us again: we are not a "fit" in the workforce. We become the creme de-la-creme of underperformers, the "anemic royalty" of Nirvana's  song "Pennyroyal Tea."

While we  reside in the supermax prisons of school and work, we label ourselves. We tattoo the letter "F" for failure the use University:

"... a concept where neurological differences are to be recognized and respected as any other human variation. These differences can include those labeled with Dyspraxia, Dyslexia, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, Dyscalculia, Autistic Spectrum, Tourette Syndrome, and others."

According to Andrew Fenton and Tim Krahn, proponents of neurodiversity strive to reconceptualize autism and related conditions in society by:
Acknowledging  that neurodiversity does not require a cure.
Changing the language from the current "condition, disease, disorder, or illness"-based nomenclature.
Broadening the understanding of healthy or independent living"; acknowledging new types of autonomy.
Giving neurodiverse individuals more control over their treatment, including the type, timing, and whether there should be treatment at all.
The writer Joan Didion said that "we tell ourselves stories in order to live." By telling our stories, we reacquire purpose to resurrect dignity and joy. We become our own and each other's plastic surgeons of the human psyche; writing is the laser that will excise the scars of shame and of failure from our minds and our hearts.


The German psychiatrist, Viktor Frankl, after being imprisoned in a Nazi concentration camp, wrote in his book "Mankind's Search for Meaning":

"Between stimulus and response, there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom."

From our space, this is how we respond to the stimuli of despair :
Ideas, institutions, laws, trends, and individuals that are indifferent or hostile to neural minorities.
Publish the Neural Atypicalâ€™s Most Wanted List to contact those who are  indifferent or hostile to get their perspective.
invite neural minorities to tell their own stories, anonymously, if they prefer.
Describe individuals, ideas, or trends that are sensitive towards  neural minority needs.
Laugh, dance, and sing when suffering because of who we are.
create and publicize musical and visual expressions that honor the joy, the sadnesses and the complexity of neural atypical existence
We believe, as did some artists in the German concentration camps, that the arts will help us to cope with the despair associated with shame and failure. Art is the ointment that soothes the holocaust done in our minds and the pograms conducted in our hearts.


Since we are ostracized and belittled in the workforce, we practice anonymous publishing for self protection. We are honored to be part of this tradition, as seen in the controversial works of Thomas Paine and others.

We wear the Guy Fawkes disguise in this blog, hiding to blow up Parliament with barrels of dynamite, but to bomb neural bigotry with drones of truth.

In the movie The Matrix Reloaded, the character Morpheus addresses his people just before The Machines invade his homeland, Zion.
He says:

"Believe me when I say we have a difficult time ahead of us. But if we are to be prepared for it, we must first shed our fear of it. I stand here, before you now, truthfully unafraid. Why? Because I believe something you do not? Tonight, let us shake this cave. Tonight, let us tremble these halls of earth, steel, and stone, let us be heard from red core to black sky. Tonight, let us make them remember:
 THIS IS ZION AND WE ARE NOT AFRAID."
we mine  our neurons to rebuild neural nets.
Our minds are our Zion. inIn this blog, we are anonymous, hiding and protecting our identity to free the hostile matrix of school and work that was designed by and for those who believe in cognitive genocide.
In this blog, we shed our fear of hostile work environments and pseudo-accommodating  schools. We never forget that, despite the neurotypical's efforts to marginalize, to fire, to flunk, to commit, and to imprison us:

WE ARE STILL HERE IN THE ZION OF OUR MINDS!

So, let our loud, late, lively, and lovely voices speak: We are not afraid. We remember:
WE ARE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.
