2. Nos te video.


The German psychiatrist, Viktor Frankl, after being imprisoned in a Nazi concentration camp, wrote in his book "Mankind's Search for Meaning" that Between stimulus and response, there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom."

 ## Here is our response:

> 1. Publish stories about neural atypicals (anonymously,if necessary).
>
> 2. Discuss ideas sensitive towards neural minorities.
>
> 3. Add institutions or individuals to the Neural Atypicalâ€™s Most Wanted List.
>
> 4. Laugh, dance, and sing when suffering because of who we are.
>
> 5. create and publicize musical and visual expressions that honor the joy, the sadnesses and the complexity of neural atypical existence.

We believe, as did some artists imprisoned in the German concentration camps, that the arts help us to cope with, despair, shame, and failure.
