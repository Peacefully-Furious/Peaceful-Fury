# Peaceful Fury

## Sumus te. Tu nobis

Call me Peaceful Fury.

I am ADHD. I am Bipolar.

I belong to a neural minority that is only 4 percent of humanity.

I am neural atypicals; my mind i wired like xxxx (use a metaphor with how our minds are wired the mind)

Compare tit o the wiring of th minds of neuro typicals.

I am THE OTHER. I  copresent with the disorder of despair.


(NEED TO CLARIFY THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN NEURO TYPICALS AND NEURO ATYPICALS)

We are neural snowflakes, each more unique than similar. (REWRITE)

I attended your schools,

I was sentenced to special education programs and then paroled to sit in classrooms. The neuro typicals  whisper, point and sneer "They are special." I  struggled with conventional schooling because I was frustrated with pedagogy that not mirror how I learned.

I persevered, graduated from college and got a job. But the neural typicals label me: This job is not a good "fit" for you. I become the creme de-la-creme of underperformers, the "anemic royalty" of Nirvana's song "Pennyroyal Tea."

While spending time in the supermax prisons of school and work, we label ourselves. We tatoo the letter "F" for failure on our minds and the letter "S" for shame on our hearts. We wear these scars in jails, in rehab facilities, in mental hospitals, and in divorce courts. We have progressed; where schools once labeled us "special"; now the courts label us "criminals."

The writer Joan Didion said that "we tell ourselves stories in order to live." By telling our stories, We become a plastic of our deformed psyche. Writing is the surgical laser that exciseS (find another word?) the scars of shame AND failure from our minds and our hearts.

Art is the ointment that soothes the holocaust done in our minds and the pograms conducted in our hearts.

Since we are ostracized and belittled in the workforce, we publish anonymously to protect ourselves.

We are honored to be part of this tradition, as seen in the controversial works of Thomas Paine and others. EXPAND AND REWRITE

We wear the Guy Fawkes mask not to blow up Parliament with barrels of dynamite, but to bomb neural bigotry with drones of truth. REWRITE THIS SENTENCE

I
WE rebuild neural nets. (HOW? CORRECT TERM?)

We are anonymous, hiding and protecting our identity to COEXIST WITH the hostile matrix of school and work that was designed by and for those who practice cognitive genocide.

In the movie The Matrix Reloaded, the character Morpheus addresses his people just before The Machines invade Zion, his city of refugee.

He says:

"Believe me when I say we have a difficult time ahead of us. But if we are to be prepared for it, we must first shed our fear of it. I stand here, before you now, truthfully unafraid. Why? Because I believe something you do not? Tonight, let us shake this cave. Tonight, let us tremble these halls of earth, steel, and stone, let us be heard from red core to black sky. Tonight, let us make them remember:

 THIS IS ZION AND WE ARE NOT AFRAID.


We shed our fear of hostile work environments and pseudo-accommodating schools. We never forget that, despite the neurotypical's efforts to marginalize, fire, flunk, commit,and imprison us:

WE TOO ARE STILL HERE!

So, let our loud, late, lively, and lovely voices speak:

WE ARE NOT AFRAID.

ITS OUR TIME

WE ARE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

Namaste
