Sumus te. Tu nobis

We are neural minorities; We are ADHD. We are Aspergers. We are Autistic. We are OCD. We are Tourette's. We are others. We are neuralnatypicals in a neurotypical world. We attend your schools and sit next to you at your jobs. We are 4 percent of the world's population.

We are neural snowflakes, each more unique than similar. (REWRITE)

We have been sentenced to inadequate special education programs and then paroled to sit in classrooms with the neural normals, who whisper and point at us and say "they are special." Then, we struggle with conventional schooling because we are frustrated with pedagogy that neither stimulates not represents how we learn.

Somehow we persevere, graduate and work. But, the neural atypicals relabel us again: we are not a "fit" in the workforce. We become the creme de-la-creme of underperformers, the "anemic royalty" of Nirvana's song "Pennyroyal Tea."

While spending time in the supermax prisons of school and work, we label ourselves. We tatoo the letter "F" for failure on our minds and the letter "S" for shame on our hearts. We wear these scars in jails, in rehab facilities, in mental hospitals, and in divorce courts. We have progressed; where schools once labeled us "special"; now the courts label us "criminals."

We adovcate the concepts of Radical Neurodiversity, which is, according to the National Symposium on Neurodiversity, held at Syracuse University:

"... a concept where neurological differences are to be recognized and respected as any other human variation. These differences can include those labeled with Dyspraxia, Dyslexia, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, Dyscalculia, Autistic Spectrum, Tourette Syndrome, and others."

According to Andrew Fenton and Tim Krahn, proponents of Radical Neurodiversity strive to reconceptualize autism and related conditions in society by:

Acknowledging  that neurodiversity does not require a cure.

Changing the language from the current "condition, disease, disorder, or illness"-based nomenclature.

Broadening the understanding of healthy or independent living"; acknowledging new types of autonomy.

Giving neurodiverse individuals more control over their treatment, including the type, timing, and whether there should be treatment at all.

The writer Joan Didion said that "we tell ourselves stories in order to live." By telling our stories, we reacquire purpose to resurrect dignity and joy. We become our own and each other's plastic surgeons of the human psyche; writing is the laser that will excise the scars of shame and of failure from our minds and our hearts.

The German psychiatrist, Viktor Frankl, after being imprisoned in a Nazi concentration camp, wrote in his book "Mankind's Search for Meaning" that Between stimulus and response, there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom."

From our space, this is how we respond to the stimuli of despair :
Ideas, institutions, laws, trends, and individuals that are indifferent or hostile to neural minorities:

Publish the Neural Atypicalâ€™s Most Wanted List to contact those who are  indifferent or hostile to get their perspective.

invite neural minorities to tell their own stories, anonymously, if they prefer.
Describe individuals, ideas, or trends that are sensitive towards  neural minority needs.

Laugh, dance, and sing when suffering because of who we are.
create and publicize musical and visual expressions that honor the joy, the sadnesses and the complexity of neural atypical existence.

We believe, as did some artists imprisoned in the German concentration camps, that the arts help us to cope with, despair, shame, and failure. Art is the ointment that soothes the holocaust done in our minds and the pograms conducted in our hearts.

Since we are ostracized and belittled in the workforce, we publish anonymously to protect ourselves.

We are honored to be part of this tradition, as seen in the controversial works of Thomas Paine and others. EXPAND AND REWRITE

We wear the Guy Fawkes disguise in this blog, hiding to blow up Parliament with barrels of dynamite, but to bomb neural bigotry with drones of truth.

In the movie The Matrix Reloaded, the character Morpheus addresses his people just before The Machines invade his homeland, Zion. He says:

"Believe me when I say we have a difficult time ahead of us. But if we are to be prepared for it, we must first shed our fear of it. I stand here, before you now, truthfully unafraid. Why? Because I believe something you do not? Tonight, let us shake this cave. Tonight, let us tremble these halls of earth, steel, and stone, let us be heard from red core to black sky. Tonight, let us make them remember:

 THIS IS ZION AND WE ARE NOT AFRAID.

We mine our neurons to rebuild neural nets. Our minds are our Zion. inIn this blog, we are anonymous, hiding and protecting our identity to free the hostile matrix of school and work that was designed by and for those who believe and practice cognitive genocide.

In this blog, we shed our fear of hostile work environments and pseudo-accommodating schools. We never forget that, despite the neurotypical's efforts to marginalize, to fire, to flunk, to commit, and to imprison us:

WE ARE STILL HERE IN THE ZION OF OUR MINDS!

So, let our loud, late, lively, and lovely voices speak: We are not afraid. We remember:

WE ARE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

Namaste
