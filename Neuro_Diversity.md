We advocate the concepts of Radical Neurodiversity, which is, according to the National Symposium on Neurodiversity, held at Syracuse University:

"... a concept where neurological differences are to be recognized and respected as any other human variation. These differences can include those labeled with Dyspraxia, Dyslexia, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, Dyscalculia, Autistic Spectrum, Tourette Syndrome, and others."

According to Andrew Fenton and Tim Krahn, proponents of Radical Neurodiversity strive to reconceptualize autism and related conditions in society by:

Acknowledging  that neurodiversity does not require a cure.

Changing the language from the current "condition, disease, disorder, or illness"-based nomenclature.

Broadening the understanding of healthy or independent living"; acknowledging new types of autonomy.

Giving neuro atypical  individuals more control over their treatment, including the type, timing, and whether there should be treatment at all.
