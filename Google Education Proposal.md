# Google Education Proposal

George THOMPSON:
	I am thinking about creating online a series of online courses using the Google Education  Platform These courses would be enrich meant ones. I am looking for child who could test an hour long course. Could I borrow your child?  What topic(s) would she be interested in? Upon completion of this course, I plan to provide a mutually agreed upon reward, chosen by the child (within reason). I need to apply for a 503b non profit status, acquire the Google Education platform and then design the course based upon your childâ€™s interest, so this wonâ€™t be anytime soon (probably in 6 months). The thing I would need from  your child would be: 1. A brief interview to discuss potential topics and determine if there are any special needs that I need to consider before I design the course. 2. Complete the course. 3. Participate in brief interview to see what what they thought of the course. 4. Get their reward. The total amount of time to complete the first steps would be 2 hours. Step 4 might take more of all of our time, depending upon the nature of the reward your child requests! Remember, it must be REASONABLE and MUTUALLY NEGOTIATED and AGREED UPON. ðŸ˜Š Examples of REASONABLE REWARDS include, but are not limited to, meals, toys, party, family day trip, books and and minor verbal about of my person, etc. Examples of UNREASONABLE REWARDS would include, but are not limited to, cars, (especially MercedesðŸ˜Š), large sums of cash, overnight family trips, meals at places like Ruthâ€™s Crisp, and extreme verbal about of my person, etc
David Branscome:
	Ruthâ€™s Crisp has the best potato chips in history
Diane Bransomb:
	This sounds more like a Skye thing. Delaney doesnâ€™t do well with commitment. But the first thing Skye does when she comes over to my house is head for the computer.
George THOMPSON:
	which is why I would bribe her ðŸ˜Š
	I included sky as part of my study group
David Branscome:
	I think it actually sounds pretty cool. I'd like to see what you come up with
Diane Bransomb:
	Did you include Chandler? Sheâ€™s another big online kid.
George THOMPSON:
	Have her name her price. Ruths Crips potato chips works.. and water. Nothing more..
	She is? I wasnâ€™t sure how mature she was
Diane Bransomb:
	She and Skye have very similar interests and levels online. I think both have done some kind of coding stuff. Delaney would start strong for camaraderie but would quit on you.
David Branscome:
	You are harsh. Delaney is a very good worker
George THOMPSON:
	What are you guys doing tomorrow night? Come over. The Google platform would be free (hardware, software, apps, storage, IT help). Getting 503b certification would be a couple humbled dollars. Same for a chrome book. Google certified as a Google Education Teacher would be 100 to 150 for all of the certifications, depending upon the number of certification. I know how to use all of the apps and I know how to design online courses. I also want to make all these courses ADA (American with Disabilities Act) accessible, for those with congnitive disabilities which the Google Platform already is.
	I wasnâ€™t talking about Delney lacking in maturity. I was talking about Chandlerâ€¦. Lol. I m surprised to hear that you think Delaney would quit on me? I may have to assign her another task that you think she would suceed in. After all, I cant have all of the Squad  except for one member participate! ðŸ˜Š lol
David Branscome:
	How do you humble a couple dollars?
George THOMPSON:
	???
Diane Bransomb:
	Delaney says sheâ€™ll do it. Are you ready to start planning already? We canâ€™t do night. Delaney needs to head to bed around 8.
Once you have your team assembled, give us some notice when you want to do your think tank.
David Branscome:
	You said the 503b would require a couple humbled dollars.
George THOMPSON:
	Humble?
	I think I can actually get it done for 75
Diane Bransomb:
	Wow
George THOMPSON:
	Diane: I m not going to have them all over here for planning. I plan of discussing a potential course topic with each family individually. I just wanted to have u guys over to eat just to hang out with some others I am planning on having over. This could be before 8. And I wanted to show David the technology involved in creating this platform. I have been thinking about this for a few yers and not that I wm considering going into teaching, I think this could be my nitch.
	Yeah, I just found a 503b for around 75, need check how legit it is.
	I would like to have proof of concept to share with private/charter schools
	Unless any of The Squad members have any cognitive disorders, as defined by ADA 508 requirements, I am going to need to find obe who does.
Diane Bransomb:
	Can we let you know at meeting if weâ€™ll have energy to out tomorrow?
George THOMPSON:
	Yeah..
	David, perhaps you and I can do lunch?
David Branscome:
	Do we get extra rewards if Delaney has a cognitive disorder? I'm pretty sure I can inflict one on her.
George THOMPSON:
	LOL.. that can be arranged.. as log as she doesnâ€™t quit on meðŸ˜Š
	The reason I am not letting all of the girls meet together is so that I dont have a bipolar manic reaction ðŸ˜Š
David Branscome:
	We can do lunch on Monday if you like. I am free between noon and 1:00 right now.
George THOMPSON:
	??
	I will create a funding proposal for a crowd sourcing platform. I found one that does not collect and of the funds raised. But my best tools are human; My brotherâ€™s best friend ( and adopted family friend)has worked at a number of prominent non profits as a VP of fund raising.  My best friend from high school is CEO of the Hilton Foundation (as in Paris Hilton lol), which is soon to be the second largest non profit organization, next to MS, as soon as Conrad Hilton transfers a few billion dollars this year). Both of them have agreed to review my grant proposals
